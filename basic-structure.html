  In Dark Patterns: Deception vs. Honesty in UI Design, Harry Brignull discusses
   what he feels like is a taboo topic: deception in web design. He mentions
    that it shouldn’t be a surprise that deception is part of web design because
     deception is “deeply entwined with life on this planet.” He goes on to
      discuss the work that is happening on darkpatterns.org to identify dark
       patterns and the companies that use these tactics online. The article
        discusses how most of the web design techniques that web designers are
         taught can be easily flipped to be used in this manipulative manner. A
          few examples he mentions as dark patterns are hidden costs, hiding
           negative feedback, hiding key information, free trials that roll into
            paid plans, etc. To conclude his article, he mentions that Expedia
             previously used dark patterns on their website before correcting
              their actions and creating a more ethical site.

  In How E-Commerce Sites Manipulate You Into Buying Things You May Not Want,
  Jennifer Valentino-DeVries similarly discusses the use of dark patterns in
  commercial web design. Her primary example was a site called ThredUp which
  used fake names and locations to show users notifications such as “Alexandria
   from Anaheim” just saved $200, when in fact “Alexandria from Anaheim” did
   not even exist. She mentions that “the website’s code pulled combinations
  from a preprogrammed list of names, locations and items and presented them as
   actual recent purchases.” I found this example of deception to be the most
    ridiculous of any of the examples. While the other tactics definitely affect
     me more, this example was absurd. Valentino-DeVries also discusses how some
      senators have tried to make strides towards regulating dark patterns, but
       it is hard to pin down exactly what qualifies under the umbrella of dark patterns.
