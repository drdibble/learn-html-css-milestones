  <h3>First paragraph</h3>
<p class="blue">
  <i>In How E-Commerce Sites Manipulate You Into Buying Things You May Not Want</i>,
  Jennifer Valentino-DeVries similarly discusses the use of <b>dark patterns</b> in
  commercial web design. Her primary example was a site called ThredUp which
  used fake names and locations to show users notifications such as “Alexandria
   from Anaheim” just saved $200, when in fact “Alexandria from Anaheim” did
   not even exist. She mentions that “the website’s code pulled combinations
  from a preprogrammed list of names, locations and items and presented them as
   actual recent purchases.” I found this example of deception to be the most
    ridiculous of any of the examples. While the other <em>tactics</em> definitely affect
     me more, this example was absurd. Valentino-DeVries also discusses how some
      senators have tried to make strides towards regulating dark patterns, but
       it is hard to pin down exactly what qualifies under the umbrella of <strong>dark patterns</strong>.

  Had the ball not bounced over the fence, Diaz would have easily scored. Instead,
  crew chief Sam Holbrook called the umpires back toward the infield and the umpires
  made a decision: the ball would be ruled a ground-rule double and Diaz would need
  to return to third base. The score would remain tied at 4, only to be broken a half-inning
  later by a walk-off homer from Red Sox catcher Christian Vazquez, cementing a 6-4 Boston
  victory and setting up an elimination game for Tampa Bay on Monday in Game 4 at <a href="https://www.mlb.com/redsox/ballpark">Fenway Park</a>.
